So stage one… our goal is simple: make magic and pretend it was easy.\nBackend Dev: Can we skip the “pretend” part?\nNora: No. It’s part of the company culture now.\n\nNora: First, the LLMs. Client wants to try all models. We’ll set up the playground.\nBackend Dev: Okay, I’ll handle the endpoints.\nFrontend Dev: And I’ll make it look shiny so they think we’re geniuses.\nKero: You are geniuses. Please don’t quit.\n\nNora: Next, OCR. We just need a simple demo for stage one.\nFrontend Dev: Not simple for me, but sure.\nBackend Dev: Bro, same.\nNora: Guys… positive energy, please. Fake it if needed.\n\nNora: Also memory. Client wants conversations saved.\nBackend Dev: That one is fine.\nFrontend Dev: Finally something fine. I feel hope again.\n\nKero: Before we finish, any blockers?\nFrontend Dev: Yes… my life.\nNora: Not accepted. Try again.\nFrontend Dev: Nope, then no blockers.\n\nNora: Great. Let’s deliver stage one. If anyone needs help, message me… not at 4 AM please.\nTeam: laughs nervously\nKero: Meeting closed. Go build cool stuff.",
